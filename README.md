## Requirements

- AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
- AWS CDK - v2
- NodeJS 14.x installed
- CDK bootstrapped in your account

## Deploy this project

Deploy the project to the cloud:

```
cdk synth
cdk deploy
```

When asked about functions that may not have authorization defined, answer (y)es. The access to those functions will be open to anyone, so keep the app deployed only for the time you need this project running.

To delete the app:

```
cdk destroy
```

### AWS CDK useful commands

- `npm run build` compile typescript to js
- `npm run watch` watch for changes and compile
- `npm run test` perform the jest unit tests
- `cdk deploy` deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
- `cdk diff` compare deployed stack with current state
- `cdk synth` emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
